Case Study: Syracuse University E-Sports Complex Development ðŸŽ®

Excited to share a case study on the "Syracuse University E-Sports Complex Development" project completed in Spring 2024 at Syracuse University! This project focused on creating a state-of-the-art E-Sports facility within the Schine Student Center.

Project Overview:

Syracuse University recognized the growing popularity of E-Sports and the need for dedicated space to support student engagement and potential academic programs.  The project involved: Â  

Constructing a 5,500 square foot E-Sports complex.  Â  

Equipping it with 34 seated gaming stations.  Â  

Adding virtual reality booths and arcade equipment.  Â  

Relocating the SU Book Store to accommodate the new complex.  Â  

The goal was to complete the project by September 3, 2024, in time for the new school semester.  Â  

Project Stages:

The project followed a structured approach, including:

Initiate Phase: Developed a project charter to define the project's scope, objectives, and stakeholders.  Key elements included a business case, problem statement, and stakeholder register.  Â  

Plan Phase: Created detailed plans for communication, risk management, human resources, and quality.  This ensured potential challenges were addressed proactively and project execution was well-organized.  Â  

Execute Phase: Focused on putting the project plan into action, managing work packages, change control, issues, communication, quality, and risks.  Â  

Monitor and Control Phase: Tracked project progress through status reports, variance reports, and regular meetings.  This ensured the project stayed on schedule and within budget.  Â  

Close Out Phase: Formalized project completion with an after-action review, obtaining a Certificate of Occupancy, archiving documents, client sign-off, and a final audit.  Â  

Key Project Management Skills Gained:

This project allowed me to develop and enhance several key project management skills:

Planning and Scheduling: Creating detailed project plans, defining tasks, estimating timelines, and using tools like Gantt charts to visualize project schedules.  Â  

Risk Management: Identifying potential risks (e.g., permit delays, subcontractor availability) and developing mitigation and contingency plans.  Â  

Stakeholder Management: Identifying and analyzing stakeholders, developing communication plans, and managing expectations.  Â  

Communication: Implementing various communication methods to keep stakeholders informed and engaged throughout the project lifecycle.  Â  

Quality Management: Establishing quality standards, implementing quality control measures, and ensuring deliverables meet requirements.  Â  

Budget Management: Estimating project costs, developing a budget, and monitoring expenses to ensure the project stays within financial constraints.  Â  

Problem-solving: Addressing unexpected issues and implementing effective solutions to keep the project on track.  Â  

Lessons Learned:

The importance of proactive risk management to mitigate potential disruptions.  Â  

Effective communication is crucial for stakeholder alignment and project success.  Â  

Detailed planning and scheduling are essential for managing complex construction projects.  Â  

Quality control measures must be integrated throughout the project lifecycle.  Â  

This project provided invaluable hands-on experience in applying project management principles to a real-world scenario. I'm proud of the work accomplished and the skills I've gained!
